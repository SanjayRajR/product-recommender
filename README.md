# product-recommender

Welcome to our product recommendor. 

In this repository, we have built a product recommender using the concept of Market Basket Analysis (Apriori Algorithm) to implement a recommender.


# Working
In this project, there is a home page that displays a few latest products on our portal. 
We further have a cart page and Products page.
In the products page, you can see a list of products and choose your favorite product and add it to the cart. At the time of checkout, we display other products that you may be interested in and you can choose whether to buy those products or not.
But, be sure to register yourself and login, before we can recommend products for you.


# How to get this working

You will have to open the anaconda prompt or any command line interface (CLI) and run the following commands after navigating to the project folder :

### python manage.py makemigrations

### python manage.py migrate

### python manage.py runserver
